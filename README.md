# TODO CLI Application

## üìã Overview

The TODO CLI application is a command-line tool for managing tasks effectively. It allows users to add, edit, delete, and list tasks, as well as manage their statuses (`todo`, `in-progress`, and `done`). This lightweight application ensures you stay organized and on top of your to-do list.

This project is an idea of the Roadmap.sh project:
https://roadmap.sh/projects/task-tracker

## ‚ú® Features

- Add tasks with a description.
- Edit tasks by ID and update descriptions.
- Delete tasks individually or clear all tasks.
- List tasks by status or display all tasks.
- Mark tasks as `todo`, `in-progress`, or `done`.
- Manage tasks with an intuitive command-line interface.

```

The script performs the following:
- Adds multiple tasks.
- Edits task descriptions.
- Deletes specific tasks.
- Marks tasks as `in-progress` or `done`.
- Lists tasks filtered by status.
- Clears all tasks.

### Sample Output
The test script provides detailed outputs, indicating success or failure for each operation.

## üåü Features to Add
- Support for due dates and priority levels.
- Export tasks to a file (e.g., JSON or CSV).
- Import tasks from a file.
- Add encryption for sensitive data.
- (MacOS Feature) Create an hidden folder in icloud to store tasks.
